Exercise 1 --> I added the dependencies required to the pom.xml file.

Exercise 2 --> Demo.java is a classs with a method isgreater(num1, num2) that returns if the first number is greater than the 2nd one. DemoTest.java is the test that try passing 2 numbers and confirm that the method is working.
Pom.xml is configurated to skip tests.


Exercise 3 and 4 --> To package app I used mvn package (editing the pom.xml depending on the type).I put the generated files (jar and war) on the Topic2-Maven folder.


Also I added to .gitignore the folders of the project I wanted to ignore (like \target).
